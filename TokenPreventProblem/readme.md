### Prevent Token Reuse After Logout
## ❓ **Question:**

I'm using **token-based authentication** in my web application (e.g., using JWT tokens).  

If someone steals my token and I **logout**, that person can **still use my token** until it expires, since **JWT tokens are stateless** and can't be invalidated once issued.

This is a **serious security concern**.  
How can I **invalidate tokens after logout**, even if someone else has them?

Also, I **don’t want to store every token in the database** forever because that could impact performance.  

What is the best way to solve this using **Redis**?

## ✅ **Answer:**

You're absolutely right. This is a common problem with **stateless authentication** like JWT.

When you logout:
- The server **doesn't know** about the token anymore.
- The stolen token can still be used **until it expires**, which is a security risk.

To solve this, we can use **Redis as a blacklist** to track tokens that should no longer be accepted, like after logout.

## 🧠 **Solution Using Redis (Token Blacklisting)**

### 🔐 **Step-by-step approach**:

1. **On Logout:**
   - Save the **token in Redis** with an expiry time **equal to its original expiration time**.
   - This marks it as **blacklisted**.

2. **On Every Request:**
   - First, **validate** the JWT.
   - Then, **check Redis** if the token is blacklisted.
     - If it **exists in Redis**, reject the request.
     - If not, proceed.

3. **Automatic Cleanup:**
   - Redis automatically removes keys after expiry.
   - So no manual cleanup needed — **no DB bloat**.

### 🔁 **Why Redis is perfect for this?**
- **In-memory**: Super fast reads and writes.
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Tokens expire automatically.
- **Scalable**: Easily used in distributed systems.
